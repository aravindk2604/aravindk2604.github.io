<p align="justify">Hey there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Aravind Krishnan and 
I'm a recent graduate in Robotics Enginnering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
This website will showcase my professional and personal projects and creative work that I undertake.</p>

<p align="justify">My journey from Bengaluru (India) to Rosenheim (Germany) and then to Worcester (USA)
has been eventful and with a great deal of learning, literally! More about that on my Resume. I like to travel and explore the scenic places. I sketch, play guitar or read books when I find time and nothing else to do. </p>

<p align="justify"> Please take time to have a look at my Projects, Blog and my Creative work. </p>
